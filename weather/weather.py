#SERVER NOTES
#MCP acts as a wrapper around different functionalities. Here, the MCP is acting as a wrapper around the NWS API. 
#What are some different things MCP can do?
##Tools: Functions/actions the server can perform, and they have names/descriptions/parameters which make them usable by an LLM. In this server, get_alerts and get_forecast are the tools
##Resources: File-like data clients can read, like API responses, file contents, logs
##Prompts: Templates that help users accomplish tasks. Basically a guide for LLMs on HOW to use these tools/resources above

#CLIENT NOTES
#Component (in this case Claude for Desktop) which knows how to speak MCP protocol, intermediary btwn LLM and MCP servers
#AI model tells MCP what tool/resource/parameters -> MCP client sends request to server -> gets responses, passes back to AI model
##IMPORTANT: LLM never directly calls ext APIs or services, tells MCP client, MCP client handles execution through server
###What does MCP client handle? Lifestyle w servers (init, msge exchange, termination), protocol neg (what features supported), and security boundaries

#HOST NOTES
#ai application user interacts with (claude desktop). In our case, it'll be the web app/or application within excel
#Contains/manages 1+ MCP clients
#Interprets user requests, decides with LLM help which MCP server capability is needed, and tells MCP client to make the call

#COMM FLOW: User input -> host & llm processing -> client request -> server execution -> server response -> client to host/llm -> llm makes response -> user display to user

            return None #If there's any exception within the try block, jump execution here. the function returns none, so request didn't get valid date
            # None return value is checked by calling functions (get_alerts, get_forecast to see if they got data or need to return an error message)

#https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/default/alerts_query - Here's the link to the API, schema has the features being used here!
##application/geo+json - that's how they knew to do geo+json content under headers
##NOTED: compare Sage API with this to figure out where the formatting is similar/different

#NWS API alert requests return data in GeoJSON format, good for computers but not human readable. format_alert converts NWS API object (raw, machine readable) and converts it into something that is
#concise and human readable, which (that string) will be fed into the LLM to understand the alert deets without going throgh complicated JSON
